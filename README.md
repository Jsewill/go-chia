# Go Chia Blockchain
## WARNING: This project is still in early pre-alpha; nothing in this repository should be considered to work yet, everything is likely to change.
### Consider this project abandoned, unless and until I become independently wealthy or receive funding.

Go Chia endeavors to be an original, complete, and compatible client for the Chia Blockchain, written in Go (http://golang.org/). We hope to gain improved efficiency and code clarity over Chia Blockchain (https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/), while maintaining stable compatiblity.
