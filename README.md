# Go Chia Blockchain
## WARNING: This project is still in early alpha; nothing in this repository should be considered to work yet, everything is likely to change.

Go Chia endeavors to be an original, complete, and compatible client for the Chia Blockchain, written in Go (http://golang.org/). We hope to gain improved efficiency and code clarity over Chia Blockchain (https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/), while maintaining stable compatiblity.

There are currently no plans to use the original Chia code. However, should this change, a copy of the Chia license will be included with this project, and any necessary attributions will be made.
